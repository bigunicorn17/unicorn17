    <h2 class="head"> Why This Is A Site I Created </h2>
    <p> I created this site because from personal experience I know that some people don't like to run. So, I thought if I made this site, maybe more people would be interested. I also created this site becasue people who run may sometimes not know how to relieve a cramp, how to get in shape, or where they should run. So, I created this site to tell runners about these things.</p>
    <h2 class="head">Why People Should Run</h2>

    <p> People should run because running is good for your overall health. Reasearch shows that running raises your good cholesterol. It also helps your lungs. When you run you are using your lungs more. I know it sounds crazy but, running can boost your immune system. Running helps lower your risk of developing blood clots. Another thing that may sound crazy is that running actually lowers the risk of women getting breast cancer. It lowers the risk of you getting storke. Doctors today recommend that people in the early stages of diabetes, high blood pressure, and osteoporosis (bones that are weak and brittle) should run. Believe it or not, running also lowers the risk of having a heart attack. I bet that anyone can guess it, but running may help you lose weight. Running boosts your confidence and eliminates depression. And last but not least, running relieves stress. This information was found at</p>

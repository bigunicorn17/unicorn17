    <h2> Where Should I Run?</h2>
    <p> You should run in your small neighborhood, on a track, or on a trail. It is not good to run on a treadmill becuase when you run on a treadmill, your ligaments and tendons are baning together up and down when you run.</p>

    <h2 class="head">Why Should I Run On A Track?</h2>
    <ol>
      <li> You should run on a track because it has no elevation and is pretty even.</li>
      <li>Also, a track is pretty soft. The track at the Olympics is soft so it is good on the body</li>
      <li>You can zone out and you will still be running correctly. When you run on a track you don't have to think about where you are going.</li>
      <li> And depending on where the track is, sometimes you can see the layout of a city. You can see beyond just the school or just the stadium.</li>
      <li> And last, you can run an exact mile. You can run exactly a quarter mile. You can run exactly anything.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If you have side stiches, well then welcome to this page. From personal experience I know that side stiches suck. They hurt when you run and then they slow you down. So here are some easy tips on how to get rid of cramps.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>STRETCH before you go on a run</li>
      <li>Start off SLOW and build up your speed</li>
      <li> Breathe NORMAL it that doesn't work,try exhailing on your left foot</li>
      <li>If that doesn't work then try taking in a breath then waiting 3 steps before EXHAILING. Reapeat this process until the cramp is gone</li>
      <li>Use your hand to apply pressure to the painful area. I found this very HELPFUL!</li>
      <li>If you get a cramp SLOW DOWN and maybe walk to get in enough air</li>
      <li> Instead of STRETCHING before the run, stretch in the middle of the run when you get a cramp</li>
      <li>Some people may say this is bad, but when you get a cramp stop, and wait. Then, slowly start to walk again. When you inhale, put your arms over your head, so your shadow looks like a EYE. You should look like this</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="head">Why Do We Get Cramps?</h2>
    <p>Cramps occur because the diaphragm is the muscle that separates the stomach and abdomen from the heart and lungs. The diaphragm is one of the main muscles used in breathing.
